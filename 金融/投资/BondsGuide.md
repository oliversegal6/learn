# What's Bond
[TOC]

## Why Bond
- A balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds can help most investors accomplish long-term investment goals more effectively than a pure equity strategy.
- Bonds provide solutions for two of the three most basic investment requirements: income and capital preservation
- A bond is a security that pay a special rate of interest for a limited amount of time and returns principle on a defined time.

> A balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds can help most of you accomplish long-term investment goals more effectively than a pure equity strategy. Stock and bonds represent the two largest components of the three main asset classes recommended by most investment firms(the other would be cash). 

**Three basic investment requirements**

- Capital Preservation
- Income
- Growth 

## Who Issues Bond
- Investment banks are hired to structure bond offerings, advise issuers on the timing and terms of sale, and arrange distribution to investors.
- Bond issuers are required to publish a prospectus—a document that outlines the key provisions of each offering.
- The public sector comprises federal government issues, known as Treasuries, and state and local government issues, known as municipals. Bond proceeds fill financing gaps and help smooth out the receipt of tax revenue.
- The private sector comprises corporations that issue bonds as an alternative to bank loans and stock offerings. Bond offerings provide companies with an efficient way to raise capital and does not dilute shareholder equity.

### Public Sector
    It is dominated by two types of securities—federally issued bonds known as Treasuries, and state and local issues known as municipals.

### Private Sector
Bonds provide an alternative to stock issuance and bank loans for domestic and multinational corporations. Why issue bond rather than stock or loan:

- interest paid to bondholders provides a pretax deduction—known as [interest expense](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestexpense.asp)—to corporations. This is similar to the tax break you receive when mortgage interest is deducted from your annual income—it lowers your overall tax bill
- When companies increase stock issuance, it reduces the percentage of the company that is owned by current shareholders. the law of supply and demand suggests that if demand remains unchanged, more issuance could cause prices to decline

## How are Bond Bought and Sold
Most bonds are bought and sold over the phone through a broker-dealer. Unlike stocks, bonds are largely transacted over-the-counter and are not listed on a centralized exchange

## Why buy Bonds rather than Stocks
Bonds provide investors with an effective way to preserve capital and generate income.Stocks are more appropriate for growth objectives.

## Price

- Bonds have a bid price and an offer (also called ask) price. You sell a bond at the bid and buy a bond at the offer. The bid is always lower than the offer, and the difference is called the bid/offer spread.
- When a bond’s price trades above its $1,000 par value, it is said to be trading at a premium. When it trades below par, it is said to be trading at a discount
- Bonds are typically quoted as a percentage of par value, rather than in dollars. For example, $1,020 would simply be 102
- Bonds trade with [accrued interest](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accruedinterest.asp), which is the amount of interest accumulated, but not paid, between semiannual payment dates.

> All bonds have two price levels, or quotes, known as the bid and the offer (also called the ask). Traders purchase (or bid) for bonds at the bid price and sell them at the offer price. Since no trader is going to sell a bond below cost, the bid will always be lower than the offer
> If a bond is bid at $990 and is offered at $1,010, the bid/offer is $990/$1,010. The difference between the bid and offer is called the bid/offer spread, which in other businesses is called the margin

### Accrued Interest
    it’s the interest that accumulates (or accrues) each day between payment dates
        Accrued interest = Annual interest × (number of days ÷ 360)
        
## MATURITY

Most bond maturities range between 2 and 30 years, although there are some 40-year and even some 100-year bonds outstanding. Securities that mature in less than one year are considered money market instruments, 1- to 5-year bonds are short-term, 5- to 12-year issues are intermediateterm, and bonds maturing in more than 12 years are considered longterm
Large new bond issues usually feature several different maturities known as serial bonds, only one maturity are known as term bonds. 

- Callables: grant the issuer the right to retire a bond beginning on a specific date.
- Put Bonds: enable you to get into the driver’s seat since you’re able to request, or “put,” the bonds back to the issuer.

## COUPON

- A bond’s stated annual interest rate is known as its coupon.
- Although the coupon represents an annual rate, interest is usually paid semiannually. Bonds that do not make interest payments are known as zero coupon bonds.
- Reinvesting interest payments generates interest-on-interest, which illustrates the power of compounding
- The amount that a sum of money in the future is worth today is known as present value. Future value, on the other hand, is what your money today would be worth at some point in the future

### Zero Coupon Bonds
Zeros are issued at a deep discount to par because the money you receive at maturity includes the principal and the total interest you’ve earned. Since zeros don’t make coupon payments, they shield investors from reinvestment risk

***Present value*** the amount that a sum of money in the future is worth today

***Future value*** on the other hand, is what your money today would be worth at some point in the future

## Yield
> Yield-to-maturity calculates the percentage rate of return assuming interest payments are reinvested at the same coupon rate and the bond is held to maturity. Yield-to-call is used for bonds with early redemptions, and yield-to-worst is the lower of the two, or the lowest yield you could expect to receive
> what’s the real value of YTM? It allows you to quantify and compare different bonds by putting them on the same playing field

- When a bond is trading at par, YTM is equal to its current yield and coupon.
- When a bond is trading at a discount, YTM is greater than the coupon.
- When a bond is trading at a premium, YTM is lower than the coupon.

- [Current Yield](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentyield.asp): Current yield is an investment's annual income (interest or dividends) divided by the current price of the securit
- [YTM](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldtomaturity.asp): is the percentage rate of return assuming a bond is held until maturity and interest payments are reinvested at the same nominal yield.
- YTC: incorporates the future stream of reinvested coupon payments, the price paid for the bond, and the price you would receive at each early redemption date
- YTW: pick the lower of a bond’s YTM and YTC

## CREDIT QUALITY

- Credit rating agencies provide us with the most effective way to objectively gauge bond issuer risk.
- Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P), and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) are the three leading agencies that evaluate credit quality and then assign ratings to bond issuers.

## WHY BAD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS

> Lower inflation facilitates lower interest rates and lifts bond prices.

- Inflation occurs when spending has increased relative to supply—think of it as too much money chasing too few goods. The most widely watched inflation barometer is the Consumer Price Index, or CPI.
- Since a bond’s coupon rate does not change, inflation erodes the future value of its fixed-income stream
- Strong economic growth typically generates higher interest rates and depresses bond prices—so what’s bad for the economy (slower growth) is usually good for bond investors.

## Bond Prices and Interest Rates

- When interest rates decline, bond prices rise
- When interest rates rise, bond prices decline

> Suppose you bought a 10-year bond two years ago at par with a 5 percent coupon. Today, the same company issues another 10-year bond with identical characteristics. Interest rates, however, have declined, so the new bond is issued with a 4 percent
> coupon. Who’s happier—issuer or investor? The answer might seem obvious, but it’s also instructive. Although the issuer lowered its borrowing costs by 1 percent, it’s obvious that investors would prefer 5 percent to 4 percent. Since demand for the older bond would rise, it’ll trade at a premium—say, at 102

## MEASURING VOLATILITY
- Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond’s price to interest rate fluctuations.
- Although duration is a complicated concept, the most important part to remember is fairly straightforward—it represents the percentage change in a bond’s price given a 1 percent rise or fall in interest rates.

[Interest rate risk](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp) To measure the potential volatility caused by moves in interest rates, bond investors use [duration](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp).

## EVALUATING LIQUIDITY

- Liquidity refers to the market’s demand for (and supply of) a particular security.
- When a bond is said to have good liquidity, it can be readily converted into cash near the price at which it was last bought or sold. Illiquid securities offer higher yields but are not appropriate for investors who plan to sell their holdings prior to maturity

## TREASURY SECURITIES

- U.S. Treasury securities (Treasuries) are auctioned by the federal government and are widely considered the safest investments in the world.
- The three most common types of Treasury securities are bills (under 1 year to maturity), notes (2 to 10 years), and bonds (over 10 years to 30 years)
- Treasury yields represent the benchmarks to which all other bonds are compared. The 10-year note is the market’s bellwether.
- The current yields of the most recently auctioned securities are depicted by the Treasury yield curve. These include the 3- and 6-month bills, the 2-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year notes, and the recently suspended 30-year bond.

### Treasury bills
colloquially known as T-bills, or bills, are zero coupon securities sold at a discount to face value. Bills mature in one year or less and are auctioned every week throughout the year. Although one-year bill auctions were suspended in 2001, three other maturities are still issued: 4 weeks, 3 months (13 weeks), and 6 months (26 weeks). The 3-month T-bill yield is commonly used by investment professionals to represent the risk-free rate of return.
    Unlike other Treasuries, T-bills are always quoted by yield, not price. Since bills pay interest only at maturity, their simple yield (or discount rate) represents the difference between the purchase price and final redemption value. Simple yield, however, reflects less than one year of total return. As a result, 
    T-bills should be evaluated by their bond equivalent yield (BEY) in order to be accurately compared to the annualized compounded yield of a coupon-bearing security
        BEY = 365 * discount rate / (360 - (days to maturity * discount rate))
        
### Treasury notes 
produce semiannual interest and are auctioned in 2-year, 3-year, 5-year and 10-year maturities
    
### Treasury bonds
have maturities beyond 10 years and pay semiannual interest
    
### STRIPS
Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities, Another zero-coupon security
    
## AGENCY SECURITIES

- Agency securities are issued by federal agencies and privately run corporations known as government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to provide funding for a specific public purpose
- Agencies are Triple-A rated because the./y’re either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government
- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dominate agency issuance. Both are GSEs that facilitate home ownership in the United States

> Because of the frequency of issuance, low risk of default, and excellent liquidity, bond investors often use agencies as substitutes for Treasuries.

## MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

- Mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) are bonds secured by real estate. For our purposes, mortgage bonds are backed by residential mortgages
- The MBS market is comprised of pass-throughs and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Mortgage bond payments are received monthly and comprise interest and principal
- Mortgage investors are vulnerable to both prepayment risk, which repays principal quicker than expected, and extension risk, which returns it slower

The two most common types of mortgage bonds purchased by individual investors are pass-throughs and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations

- Pass-throughs are merely conduits—mortgage payments are collected in a pool and distributed (or passed-through, get it?) to bond investors through a trust that’s created at issuance.
- CMOs(collateralized mortgage obligations) are just a group of passthrough securities.Although there are nearly 40 different types of CMOs, most individual investors focus on two types: sequential bonds and planned amortization class (PAC) bonds.

Asset-Backed Securities: like many CMOs, they’re not typically offered to individual investors.

## CORPORATE BONDS

- The corporate bond market is normally segregated into four industry sectors: finance, industrials, transportation, and utilities
- The capital structure ranks bonds according to the claim they have on a company’s assets
- Since all corporate issuers carry some degree of risk, credit ratings are critical. These are divided into two categories: investment-grade (or high-grade) and high-yield (or junk) bonds
- Credit ratings are not stagnant. Upgrades occur when financial security strengthens, while downgrades occur when it deteriorates. These ratings changes impact investors and issuers alike

### Investment-Grade Bonds
   Investment-grade (also known as high-grade) bonds comprise issuers that are deemed to be in good financial health and are unlikely to have trouble meeting their debt obligations. Bonds are ranked from Triple-A (highest) to Triple-B (lowest).
    
### High-Yield Bonds
   Companies that do not receive investment-grade ratings are considered high-yield. The ratings agencies rank these bonds from Ba1 to C (Moody’s)
    
## MUNICIPAL BONDS
- State and local governments issue municipal bonds to finance projects that serve the public interest. General obligation (GOs) and revenue bonds are the two main types.
- Municipals are popular with individual investors since they can provide tax-free interest income
- Municipalities are assigned credit ratings just like corporate issuers. They may also purchase insurance to ensure that a new bond issue receives a Triple-A rating
- Since municipals are tax-advantaged, they have lower nominal yields than their taxable fixed-income counterparts. Taxable equivalent yields should be calculated to fairly compare municipal and taxable yields

> Municipal bonds are especially popular with U.S. investors because the federal government does not tax interest generated by the majority of these bonds. Additionally, most state and local municipalities allow investors to enjoy tax-free income from the securities issued by their home states.
> Bonds issued by U.S. territories—such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands—are tax-exempt for residents of all states, municipal securities are the only type of bond that have the potential to generate fully tax-free income
> For that reason, individuals purchase more municipals than any other bonds


### Categories of Municipal Bonds

- **Public purpose bonds** are issued directly by state or local authorities for the types of projects you’d expect governments to finance. This includes construction of public schools, sanitation facilities, water treatment plants, and highways. These bonds are exempt from federal, state and local taxes
- **Nongovernmental purpose bonds** are also fully tax-exempt securities. These bonds are used to fund initiatives that more narrowly serve the public interest or are associated with the private sector, for example, transportation authorities, private hospitals, and universities
- **Private activity bonds** are issued by municipalities but are associated with projects that are not government-run. These issues may be taxable, depending on the extent to which they benefit the public interest and typically include bonds that finance student loans, airports, industrial developments, or other special projects

### Two most common types of Muni Securities
 
- General Obligation (GO) bonds State governments dominate this type of issuance, followed by cities with large public infrastructures. GOs typically have better credit quality and experience higher demand than revenue bonds since issuers can raise taxes or tap myriad revenue streams to meet interest payments if necessary.
- Revenue bonds are backed by revenue and fees collected by the facility that’s being funded. A revenue bond is not as secure since debt service is directly supported by income generated by a specific project.

> Municipalities also issue taxable bonds, though it only represents a small part of the municipal market. Taxables are issued when the federal government is unwilling to sanction certain projects that do not broadly serve the public interest. These bonds include corporate-backed municipal
> debt related to pollution control or waste disposal. These also are issued when a municipality exceeds its tax-exempt issuance limit for certain types of bonds. Taxable munis offer yields comparable to similarly rated corporate securities.

### Taxable Equivalent Yield
   TEY is to adjust a muni yield in order to fairly compare it to a taxable security
    
   TEY = Muni YTM/(1 - Your marginal income tax rate)
    
## INTERNATIONAL BONDS

- Most fixed-income securities issued by foreign entities are structured similarly to U.S. debt. However, bonds issued in Europe pay interest annually, rather than semiannually.
- You could participate in the international market through U.S. dollar-denominated or local currency debt. U.S. dollar–denominated securities issued by non–U.S. entities are known asYankee bonds
- International bonds expose investors to myriad country-based uncertainties, collectively known as sovereign risk, and to currency risk

## PREFERRED SECURITIES

- Preferred securities may be issued as equity or debt
- A preferred has a $25 par value compared to the $1,000 face value of a bond. That’s one of the reasons they’re so popular with individual investors
- Preferreds usually feature quarterly payments, rather than the semiannual income streams provided by bonds

> Corporations that issue bonds also commonly issue preferreds. However, preferreds have several notable differences from bonds. The most prominent are their $25 par value, in contrast to the $1,000 par value of
> bonds. It’s one of the reasons they’re popular with individual investors— like a low-priced common stock, the $25 price tag just makes them more affordable. Additionally, these securities typically feature a fixed quarterly, rather than semiannual, income stream. Best of all, most preferreds

## CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES
- Convertible securities are hybrid equity and debt instruments that can be converted from a corporate bond or a preferred security into common stock
- Although convertibles provide semiannual income, their yield is lower than other fixed-income securities in exchange for capital appreciation potential
- Strict guidelines dictate convertibility

## U.S. SAVINGS BONDS
- Savings bonds are issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. There are three types: Series EE, Series I (an inflation-indexed bond), and Series HH/H.
- Although U.S. savings bonds provide the same degree of safety as Treasuries, an active secondary market does not exist.
- U.S. savings bonds are exempt from state and local taxes, and investors may defer paying federal income tax on interest for 30 years or until the bonds are redeemed.

##CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT
- Certificates of deposit (CDs) are time deposits created by banks
- Although CDs have similar characteristics to bonds, CDs are not fixed-income securities since they are not SEC-registered public debt offerings
- CDs are insured up to $100,000 (interest and principal combined) by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
- Although banks originate CDs, investors may also purchase them from broker-dealers

##FUNDS AND UNIT INVESTMENT TRUSTS
- Three types of bond funds are available: mutual funds, closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts (UITs)
- Mutual funds and closed-end funds are actively managed bond portfolios, while UITs comprise a fixed group of bonds held in a trust
- Mutual funds and closed-end funds are perpetual, while UITs mature. Each provides a monthly income stream
- Although no fund should be chosen by cost alone, it behooves investors to thoroughly review expenses prior to any investment.


##MONEY MARKET FUNDS
- Money market mutual funds provide individuals with access to higher-yielding cash-equivalent instruments.
- These funds provide a higher rate of return than savings accounts, usually offer check-writing privileges, and are readily available as cash.
- Money market funds invest in short-term securities, such as Treasury bills, CDs, banker’s acceptances, and commercial paper
