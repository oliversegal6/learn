#### A.M.T.
    Alternative Minimum Tax is a calculation designed to ensure that individuals and corporations pay their 'fair share' of federal income taxes. Interest on private activity municipal securities is subject to A.M.T.
    
#### Accrued Interest
    Based on the amount of interest earned, but not paid, as of the pricing date. Amount of interest accumulated, but not yet paid, between semiannual payment dates.
    
#### Adjustable Rate Municipal Preferred Securities
    Dividend rate is reset either every seven (7) or twenty-eight (28) days. Ask your Financial Advisor for current rates.

#### Adjustable rate preferreds
Perpetual securities with a variable, rather than fixed,
quarterly dividend that floats between an upper and lower range, or collar.

#### Adjusted Cost Basis
    The original cost of securities less the amortized premium (or plus the accretion on an original issue discount bond). Mortgage-Backed Securities or Market Discount Bonds are not adjusted.
    
#### Average Effective Maturity
    For a single bond, it is a measure of maturity that takes into account the possibility that a bond might be called back to the issuer. For a portfolio of bonds, average effective maturity is the weighted average of the maturities of the underlying bonds. The measure is computed by weighing each bond's maturity by its market value with respect to the portfolio and the likelihood of any of the bonds being called.
    
#### Average After State Tax Yield (ATY)
    The weighted average yield after state income taxes are paid on out of state bonds. It reflects both the tax free yield of an in state bond and the after tax yield of an out of state bond.
    
#### Average Coupon
    The weighted average of all the coupons in the portfolio. Zero-Coupon Bonds are included in this calculation.
    
#### Average Yield to Maturity
    Weighted average yield that assumes all bonds will go to maturity. It also assumes that all callable bonds will not be called.
    
#### Average Yield-To-Worst (Purchase Yield)
    The weighted average yield based on the purchase price of the bond. It assumes the bonds are purchased at the lower of either the yield to call or the yield to maturity.
    
#### Average Yield-To-Worst in Years
    The weighted average of years based on the purchase price of the bonds. It assumes the bonds are purchased at the lower of either the yield to the call or the yield to maturity.

#### Bonds
    Bonds are affected by a number of risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, credit risk and prepayment risk. In general, interest rate risk occurs when prevailing interest rates rise, causing bond prices to fall. Credit risk, which is the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments and repay the principal on its debt. Similarly, a decline in an issuer's credit rating, or credit worthiness, can cause a bond's price to decline. High yield bonds are subject to additional risks such as increased risk of default and greater volatility because of the lower credit quality of the issues. Finally, bonds can be subject to prepayment risk. When interest rates fall, an issuer may choose to borrow money at a lower interest rate, while paying off its previously issued bonds. As a consequence, underlying bonds will lose the interest payments from the investment and will be forced to reinvest in a market where prevailing interest rates are lower than when the initial investment was made.
   
#### Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY)
    Also referred to as a Corporate Bond Equivalent Yield (CBE), BEY is an adjustment to the mortgage yield to reflect assumed semi-annual payment of cash flows (rather than monthly). Converting monthly Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) cash flows to a semi-annual equivalent allows a more meaningful comparison of MBS values to corporate and government bonds. The conversion primarily reflects the benefit to the MBS holder of reinvesting MBS cash flows monthly rather than semi-annually, as is the case with other fixed-income securities. Bond equivalent yield calculations are currently not provided in the FIHNW report.
    
#### Cost Basis
    The price originally paid for the bonds.
    
#### Convertible Bond
    A corporate bond that can be exchanged, at the option of the holder, for a specific number of shares of the company's stock. Because a convertible bond is a bond with a stock option built into it, it will usually offer a lower than prevailing rate of return. It is subject to market risk, interest rate risk and default risk.
    
#### Convexity
    A measure of the curvature in the relationship between bond prices and bond yields that demonstrates how the duration of a bond changes as the interest rate changes. Convexity is used as a risk-management tool, and helps to measure and manage the amount of market risk to which a portfolio of bonds is exposed.
    
#### Corp/Muni Bonds
    Bonds can be called prior to maturity which may reduce yield. Ordinary call information is above. Other call features may exist. Bond prices may fluctuate reflecting market interest rates and the issuer's credit status.
    
#### Current Yield
    Coupon divided by the price. As an example a bond with a 5.00% coupon offered at $105 would have a current yield of 4.76%; 5.00/105=4.76%.
    
#### Double-Barrelled Bond
    A municipal bond secured by a defined revenue source as well as the full faith and credit of an issuer that has taxing power. It has both general obligation and revenue pledges.
    
#### Default Risk
    Possibility that a bond issuer will fail to pay principal or interest when due. Defaults can also occur for failure to meet nonpayment obligations, such as reporting requirements, or when a material problem occurs for the issuer, such as a bankruptcy.
    
#### Effective Duration
    Effective Duration measures the approximate percentage volatility of a bond's value for a 1% (100 bp) change in interest rates.
    
#### Estimated Accrued Interest
    Based on the amount of interest earned, but not paid, as of the date the report was priced.
    
#### Estimated Principal Cost
    Dollar value of proposed bonds excluding accrued interest.
    
#### Escrow-to-Maturity (ETM)
    Municipal securities for which proceeds have been deposited into an escrow account to pay principal and interest on the securities.
    
#### Face Amount
    The nominal value or dollar value of a bond stated by the issuer. It is the amount paid to the holder at maturity (generally $1,000). Also known as 'par value' or simply 'par'.
    
#### Factor
    A decimal value that reflects the proportion of outstanding principal balance of a Mortgage-Backed Security. The factor may change each month in relation to its original principal value.
    
#### Floating-Rate Bond
    Securities with a coupon interest rate that is adjusted periodically based upon market conditions.
    
#### General Obligation Bond
    A municipal bond backed by the credit and "taxing power" of the issuing jurisdiction rather than the revenue from a given project.
    
#### Investment Grade
    Bonds considered suitable for preservation of invested capital; ordinarily, those rated Baa3 or better by Moody's Investors Service, or BBB- or better by Standard & Poor's Corporation
    
#### High-Yield Bond
    A bond with unfavorable credit characteristics that is typically non-rated or rated below investment grade. A high-yield bond trades at yields substantially higher than bonds with more favorable credit characteristics and often suffers from lack of liquidity and marketability and carries more risk in exchange for the higher yield.
    
#### International/Global Investing
    International investing may not be for everyone. There may be additional risk associated with international investing, including foreign, economic, political, monetary and/or legal factors, changing currency exchange rates, foreign taxes, and differences in financial and accounting standards. The possibility that adverse political events, financial problems, or natural disasters in a country or region will cause investments in that country or region to lose value. The risks of investing in emerging or developing markets can be substantially greater than the risks of investing in developed markets.
    
#### Mortgage-Backed Securities
    Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS"), which include collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs"), also referred to as real estate mortgage investment conduits ("REMICs"), may not be suitable for all investors. There is the possibility of early return of principal due to mortgage prepayments, which can reduce expected yield and result in reinvestment risk. Conversely, return of principal may be slower than initial prepayment speed assumptions, extending the average life of the security up to its listed maturity date (also referred to as extension risk).
    Additionally, the underlying collateral supporting non-Agency MBS may default on principal and interest payments. In certain cases, this could cause the income stream of the security to decline and result in loss of principal. Further, an insufficient level of credit support may result in a downgrade of a mortgage bond's credit rating and lead to a higher probability of principal loss and increased price volatility. Investments in subordinated MBS involve greater credit risk of default than the senior classes of the same issue. Default risk may be pronounced in cases where the MBS security is secured by, or evidencing an interest in, a relatively small or less diverse pool of underlying mortgage loans.
    MBS are also sensitive to interest rate changes which can negatively impact the market value of the security. During times of heightened volatility, MBS can experience greater levels of illiquidity and larger price movements. Price volatility may also occur from other factors including, but not limited to, prepayments, future prepayment expectations, credit concerns, underlying collateral performance and technical changes in the market.
    Please read offering documents and/or prospectus information carefully for the risks associated with the particular MBS security you are purchasing.
    
#### Municipal Equivalent Yield (MEY)
    The MEY factor will help you determine whether out-of-state municipals are advantageous on a yield basis. In other words, the MEY factors will show how much you need to earn on an out-of-state municipal bond in order to account for the income taxes paid at the state level.
    
#### Market Value
    The value of the portfolio, excluding accrued interest, at the pricing date.
    
#### Missing Data
    If purchase price is unknown, the High Net Worth Report will show the issue price (often $100.00). If settlement date is unknown, High Net Worth will use the dated date as a settlement date. In addition, when a bond has 0.001 in the coupon field it indicates that the security has a coupon greater the 0% but less than 1% and may not reflect the actual coupon. Please contact your Financial Advisor if you have any questions about the actual coupon or to provide your Financial Advisor with accurate purchase dates and prices.
    
#### Net Unrealized Gain(Loss)
    The market value less the cost basis.
    
#### Par Amount
    The face amount of a security, payable to the holder at maturity.
    
#### PSA
    'Prepayment speed assumption' measures the rate of principal prepayments, which in effect influences the average life of a bond, pre-payment window, and bond equivalent yield.
    
#### Par Amount
    The face amount of a security, payable to the holder at maturity.
    
#### Preferred securities 
    can be called prior to maturity, which may reduce yield if purchased at a premium. Preferred securities may be subject to other call features or corporate restrictions that may have an effect similar to a call. Prices may fluctuate reflecting market interest rates and the issuer's credit status.
    Finally, bonds can be subject to prepayment risk. When interest rates fall, an issuer may choose to borrow money at a lower interest rate, while paying off its previously issued bonds. As a consequence, underlying bonds will lose the interest payments from the investment and will be forced to reinvest in a market where prevailing interest rates are lower than when the initial investment was made.
    
#### Redemption Value
    Dollar amount coming due based on par amount or call price.
    
#### Remaining Principal
    The amount of principal remaining to be paid under the Mortgage-Backed Security as of a given point of time. The remaining principal is calculated by applying the factor to the original face.

#### Redemption Value
    Dollar amount coming due based on par value or call price.
    
#### Scheduled After-Tax Annual Income
    Net income after federal and state taxes are applied. This calculation assumes that the investor itemizes deductions on his federal tax return. Currently, the report does not calculate the after-tax yield on various agency securities.
    
#### Scheduled Annual Income
    The total annual income that will be generated by the portfolio.
    
#### Taxable Equivalent Yield (TEY)
    The TEY calculates the yield needed in a fully taxable investment that would be equivalent to the tax-free yield of a municipal bond. A formula that converts the lower yield of a tax-exempt security into the higher yield of a taxable security. Calculating the TEY of a tax-free municipal bond allows for an "apple to apple" comparison to taxable bonds. The TEY can be used to illustrate to investors the impact of both Federal and State income taxes on their taxable investments. If the municipal bond is out of the clients home state then we use the after state tax yield to calculate TEY.
    
#### Underlying Rating
    In the case of a security for which credit enhancement has been obtained, the rating assigned by a rating agency to such security without regard to credit enhancement or assigned to other securities of the same issuer having the same features and security structure but without the credit enhancement.
    
#### Municipal Bonds
    Municipal bonds are debt obligations offered by a municipality and they generally are either revenue or general obligation bonds. As with all bonds, these are subject to the same risks, and are subject to the creditworthiness of the municipality offering them or to the revenue project for which the bonds were offered. An Investment in Municipal Bonds may be subject to state and local taxes and you may also be subject to the Federal Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Official offerings may be made only by the final Official Statement. If sold prior to maturity you may receive more or less than your original investment.
    
#### Yield To Worst
    The lowest potential yield that can be received on a bond without the issuer actually defaulting. The yield to worst is calculated by making worst-case scenario assumptions on the issue

    The average yield weighted by the purchase price of the bond.
    
#### Weighted Average Yield to Call/Maturity
    Average yield to the call (in the case of callable bonds) or to maturity (in the case of non-callable bonds), weighted by market value/par amount.
    
#### Weighted Average Yield to Maturity
    Average yield weighted by market value/par amount assuming all bonds go to maturity.
    
#### Zero Coupon Bonds
    Zero coupon bonds may experience greater price volatility than interest-bearing fixed income securities because of their comparatively longer duration. Taxable zero coupon bonds are treated as having original issue discount (OID) for tax purposes. Although interest is not received until maturity, the zero coupon bond is assumed to pay a pre-determined interest rate that will be treated as current income for tax purposes if held in a taxable account. Please consult your tax advisor regarding the consequences of owning zero coupon bonds, as well as the applicable rules that apply to such bonds.

#### Positive slope
 yields increase as maturities lengthen. A positive slope is considered
“normal” because uncertainty naturally accelerates as money is invested for longer periods of time.
#### Premium
 when a bond’s price trades above its $1,000 par value. Premium (cushion) bonds: these securities trade above par value; higher coupon
rates “cushion” the downward pressure on bond prices.
#### Prepayments (prepays)
 unscheduled mortgage bond principal payments; since
most homeowners do not adhere to a specific payment schedule, monthly cash flow generated by mortgage bonds varies over time.
#### Prepayment risk
 associated with the rise in prepays due to higher refinancing activity,
causing the amount of principal returned to the investor to be larger than expected.
#### Prepayment speeds
 traders determine the pace that principal is returned to investors

#### Private label pass-throughs
 pass-throughs that are created by financial institutions and are usually rated Triple-A or Double-A; not created by government agencies.
#### Private placements
 mostly high-yield bonds sold directly to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) rather than through a public offering; subject to an SEC regulation known as Rule 144A.

The bid or ask quotes are the most current prices and quantities at which the shares can be bought or sold. The bid quote shows the price and quantity at which a current buyer is willing to purchase the shares, while the ask shows what a current participant is willing to sell the shares for

#### Rate shock
 after interest rates have substantially declined, investors tend to look
where rates have been instead of where they are going; often leads to common mistake known as “reaching for yield.”
#### Reaching for yield
 common mistake made by bond investors whereby risk factors
are ignored due to the desire to maximize yield.

#### Request For Quote - RFQ
A request for quote (RFQ) is a type of procurement solicitation in which a company asks outside vendors to offer a quote for the completion of a specific task or project. An RFQ is similar to a request for proposal (RFP) and provides comprehensive information to the bidder concerning the project's requirements. An RFQ frequently requires the bidder to itemize costs for each phase of the project to allow the soliciting company to compare several bids

An RFQ is usually sent to several potential vendors, asking for bidder pricing. It may contain information that the bid must include for consideration, payment terms, the factors that decide which bid the company chooses and a bid submission deadline. An RFQ focuses mostly on pricing. If the minimum criteria are met, the vendor with the lowest bid is generally given the contract.

 the day money is due for an investment.
#### SEC yield
 a standard calculation that mutual funds must disclose to investors in
order to ensure that the investment may be fairly assessed compared to its peers.

#### Treasury securities
 bonds that are direct obligations of the U.S. government.
#### Treasury yield curve
 plots the yield-to-maturity of all on-the-run Treasury securities—
from 3- and 6-month bills, to 2-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year notes, plus the 30-year bond.

of the maturity date. YTC incorporates the future stream of reinvested coupon payments, the price paid for the bond, as well as the price received at each early redemption date.
#### Yield-to-maturity (YTM)
 the percentage rate of return assuming a bond is held until
maturity and interest payments are reinvested at the same nominal yield. YTM integrates any difference between par value and the actual price paid.
#### Yield-to-worst (YTW)
 the lowest yield received: it’s the lower of a bond’s YTM and
YTC. This is the most conservative way to view a bond’s potential return and should always be assessed when purchasing any callable security.
#### Zero coupon bonds (accrual bonds)
 bonds that do not make cash interest payments to investors. Instead of receiving a payment every six months, earned interest accrues to the face value of the bond until it matures at $1,000 par value. Zeros are issued at a deep discount to par.
